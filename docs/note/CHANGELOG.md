# Changelog

All notable changes to the DailyNote app will be documented in this file.

## [5.0.0] - 2025-10-19

### üé® Major UI/UX Improvements
- **Expand/Collapse Button**: Click the expand button (‚ÜóÔ∏è) to maximize the note for distraction-free writing. Icon toggles to collapse (‚ÜôÔ∏è) when expanded
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Note card expands to fill entire viewport, textarea grows to fill available space
- **Two-Line Header**: Date now displays on two semantic lines (no `<br>` tags) - "Today is [day]" on line 1, "[date]" on line 2
- **Centered Layout**: Header and note card now centered together on page for unified visual hierarchy

### ‚ú® New Features
- **State Persistence**: Expanded state saved to localStorage and restored on page refresh
- **Auto-Save**: Text auto-saves with 500ms debounce on input (no more manual save button)
- **Timestamp Tracking**: "Last edited" timestamp updates automatically on each save
- **Proper Flex Layout**: Card and textarea properly fill available vertical space when expanded

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes
- **Design System Integration**: Now uses Labs design system components (container, card, button, icon) instead of custom styling
- **Web Components**: Custom `<note-input-card>` component with Shadow DOM encapsulation
- **Enhanced Container**: Container component now supports `fill` attribute for fullscreen layouts with `height: 100vh`
- **Improved Card Component**: Card's input slot now properly supports flex-grow for vertical expansion

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Component emits `autosave`, `expanded-changed`, and `reset` events
- **Modular Component API**: Public methods: `setValue()`, `getValue()`, `focus()`, `setTimestamp()`, `toggleExpanded()`
- **State Management**: Proper localStorage handling with daily cleanup and expanded state persistence
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Full use of design system tokens for colors, spacing, typography
