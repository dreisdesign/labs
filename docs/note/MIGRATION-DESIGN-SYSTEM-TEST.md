# Note App Migration - Design System Coverage Test

**Purpose**: This migration serves as a comprehensive validation test for the Labs Design System. By rebuilding the Note app entirely from design system components, we can verify that the system is complete and modular enough to support a production app without any custom CSS hacks.

---

## Design System Components Being Tested

### 1. **Layout & Structure**
```html
<labs-container>        <!-- Manages responsive layout with built-in padding -->
  <labs-template-header-wrapped>  <!-- App header with theme toggle -->
  <labs-metric-card>    <!-- Main note display area -->
  <labs-footer-with-settings>  <!-- Footer with Add, Theme, Flavor, Reset buttons -->
</labs-container>
```

**What we're testing**:
- Container padding and responsive breakpoints
- Header integration with footer
- Footer event emissions (add, reset-all, flavor-changed)
- Settings card overlay functionality

### 2. **Data Display**
```html
<labs-metric-card>
  <span slot="label">Today's Note</span>
  <span slot="value">Note content or "No note yet"</span>
</labs-metric-card>
```

**What we're testing**:
- Metric card as generic display container (not just for numbers)
- Slot-based content insertion
- Theme application (light/dark colors)
- Responsive sizing

### 3. **User Input & Overlays** (Following Today-List Pattern)
```html
<labs-overlay open>
  <!-- Plain textarea for multiline content (Today-List pattern) -->
  <textarea id="noteTextArea"></textarea>
  
  <!-- OR labs-input-card for single-line input (label edit) -->
  <labs-input-card id="labelInput"></labs-input-card>
</labs-overlay>
```

**What we're testing**:
- Overlay open/close behavior
- Overlay scroll locking
- Plain textarea styling with design tokens (Today-List approach)
- labs-input-card for single-line inputs
- Overlay with custom content

### 4. **Actions & Feedback**
```html
<labs-button>Save</labs-button>
<labs-button variant="secondary">Cancel</labs-button>
<labs-button variant="destructive">Clear</labs-button>

<labs-toast>
  <span slot="message">Note cleared</span>
  <labs-button slot="action">Undo</labs-button>
</labs-toast>
```

**What we're testing**:
- Button variants for different actions
- Toast positioning (above footer)
- Toast with action button (Today-List pattern)
- Button click handling

### 5. **Theme System**
```javascript
// Early application to prevent flash
import { applyTheme } from '../design-system/utils/theme.js';
applyTheme({ flavor: 'blueberry', theme: 'light' });

// Footer emits events for theme changes
footer.addEventListener('flavor-changed', (e) => {
  applyTheme({ flavor: e.detail.flavor });
});
```

**What we're testing**:
- Early theme application (prevents FOUC)
- Theme persistence (localStorage)
- Flavor switching (blueberry, strawberry, vanilla)
- Dark/light mode toggling
- CSS tokens application across components

### 6. **Icons**
```html
<labs-icon name="edit" slot="icon-left"></labs-icon>
<labs-icon name="settings"></labs-icon>
```

**What we're testing**:
- Icon availability and rendering
- Icon sizing with components
- Icon theming (color from CSS tokens)

## Feature Coverage

### Core Features (Unchanged from Original)

| Feature | Implementation | Design System Used |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Display daily note | Metric card with slot | `labs-metric-card` |
| Add/edit note | Overlay with textarea | `labs-overlay` + custom textarea |
| Save note | Button in overlay | `labs-button` |
| Delete note | Footer reset-all event | `labs-footer-with-settings` |
| Undo delete | Toast with action | `labs-toast` |
| Customize label | Overlay with input | `labs-overlay` + `labs-input-card` |
| Theme toggle | Footer theme button | `labs-footer-with-settings` |
| Dark/light mode | CSS variables | Design tokens |
| Settings menu | Footer settings overlay | `labs-footer-with-settings` |
| All Apps button | Footer action | Built into footer |
| Refresh button | Custom button | `labs-button` |

### Enhanced Features

| Enhancement | How |
|-------------|-----|
| Flavor support | Automatically via footer component |
| Consistent styling | All via design tokens, no custom CSS |
| Better accessibility | Design system components are accessible |
| Responsive design | Layout components handle responsiveness |
| Theme persistence | Design system utils handle this |
| Toast positioning | Configurable via CSS tokens |

## Code Size Targets

### Current Implementation
```
index.html:    292 lines (includes 100+ lines custom CSS)
js/main.js:    440 lines (complex logic + manual DOM)
styles/main.css: ~400 lines
Total:         ~1132 lines
```

### Target Implementation
```
index.html:    ~120 lines (only markup + early theme init)
js/main.js:    ~100-120 lines (clean, DRY)
Custom CSS:    0 lines (use design tokens only)
Total:         ~220 lines
```

**Reduction**: ~82% smaller, 5x more maintainable
