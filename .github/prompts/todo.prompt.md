# TODO File Maintenance

When assisting with any project, always help maintain, update, and clean up the global `TODO.md` file at the root of the repository as the canonical project-wide checklist. This includes:
- Reviewing outstanding tasks when requested.
- Removing completed or obsolete items.
- Adding new actionable items as needed.
- Keeping the TODO file as a living checklist, referenced from main documentation.
- Never rename the TODO file for each branch; keep a single canonical file for continuity.
- When asked, provide summaries, cleanups, or periodic reviews of outstanding tasks.

For area-specific or feature-specific work (e.g., colors/theming), maintain focused TODO files (such as `COLORS-DOCS--TODO.md`) and reference them from the global TODO as needed.
