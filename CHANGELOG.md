# [Unreleased] - 2025-09-30

### üöÄ Major Architecture Improvements

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks (from TODOs & Review Queue)
- **Repository Hygiene:** Alphabetized component exports and Storybook sidebar entries for improved discoverability.
- **Review Queue Items:**
  - Container pattern: Added and documented `labs-container` and container token usage in Storybook.
  - Today page: Aligned input card/container widths and spacing between Today List and Tracker for consistent layout.
  - App cards: Added two-column and single-column responsive layout stories for app cards grid.
  - Date utility: Created `date-format.js` utility with unit tests; confirmed consistent timestamp formatting in Storybook and apps.
  - Settings safety: Ensured All Apps button in settings card only probes localhost in dev, not in production.
  - Alphabetize: Sidebar and stories now follow stable alphabetical order; script/check available for future maintenance.
- **List Item + Dropdown Component Work:**
  - Dropdown icon-only variant with `open` state (verified 2025-09-19)
  - List item slot-driven API with multiple story patterns
  - Footer migrated to shared `labs-footer` component
  - `date-format.js` utility created with unit tests
  - Mobile responsive layout for list items (completed 2025-09-20)


#### Dropdown Portal System
- **BREAKING IMPROVEMENT**: `<labs-dropdown>` now uses a document-level portal pattern to eliminate menu clipping issues
- **Portal Architecture**: Dropdown menus are rendered in a shared document-level container (`#labs-dropdown-portal`) instead of within the component's shadow DOM
- **Benefits**: No more clipped menus in list items, cards, or any container with `overflow: hidden`. Consistent z-index behavior across all contexts
- **Viewport-Aware Positioning**: Automatic menu placement with flip detection (below-preferred, above-fallback)
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing usage patterns remain identical - this is a pure architectural enhancement
- **Cleanup**: Automatic portal cleanup when components unmount, resize/scroll repositioning, proper event handling across shadow boundaries

#### List Item Component Refinements  
- **Timestamp Rendering**: Simplified `labs-list-item` to remove component-owned timestamp rendering - now uses "timestamp-as-content" pattern consistently
- **Tracker Integration**: Updated Tracker app to use `variant="text-only"` with formatted timestamps in the content slot
- **Visual Consistency**: List items in Storybook, Smoothie template, and Tracker app now have identical appearance and behavior
- **Slot Optimization**: Removed redundant label slot and internal `.labelHost` rendering logic for cleaner component architecture

### Fixed
- **Dropdown Clipping**: Resolved dropdown menus being cut off inside list items, cards, and overflow containers
- **Timestamp Duplication**: Eliminated dual timestamp rendering in list components
- **Component Parity**: Storybook stories now match real app usage patterns exactly

- **Local preview stability (2025-09-30):** Copied `design-system/src/utils/date-format.js` into `docs/design-system/utils` and adjusted `scripts/update-static-paths.js` and menu workflows to prefer `--local` preview mode so local static previews do not 404 for critical util files.

### Chore
- **Storybook sorting (2025-10-03):** Storybook preview configuration updated to use a stable alphabetical `storySort` for the sidebar (sorts by group/title then story name). Changes applied to `.storybook/preview.js` and `design-system/.storybook/preview.js` to make the sidebar ordering consistent across local and design-system Storybook instances.

### Technical
- **Portal Pattern**: Industry-standard approach used by React Portal, Vue Teleport, and Popper.js
- **Performance**: Eliminated complex viewport calculations and z-index conflicts
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation between trigger logic and menu presentation

### Chore
- **Documentation**: Updated component docs, README, and inline code comments to reflect portal architecture
- **Testing**: Verified dropdown behavior across Storybook stories and Tracker app

### Chore
- **Baseline & footer consolidation (2025-09-30):** Recorded a development baseline capturing a design-system cleanup and footer consolidation.
  - Added a new wrapper component `labs-footer-with-settings` (encapsulated footer + settings overlay wiring) and canonical Storybook story under "Components (Wrapped) / Footer ‚Üí With Settings".
  - Added responsive `Grid` and `Container` stories to demonstrate layout and tokens.
  - Removed legacy/duplicate pattern stories and consolidated template usage to prefer the new wrapper (work in progress for full template consolidation).
  - See commit: `chore: baseline before footer consolidation and cleanup` (local commit recorded in repo history).

# [Released] - 2025-09-20

# üéØ v2.4.6 - Service Worker & Docs Stability Release (September 21, 2025)

### Added
- **Unregister helper:** `scripts/unregister-sws.js` ‚Äî Puppeteer-based utility to mass-unregister broken service workers during recovery situations (commit `4a40b56`).

### Fixed
- **Service workers (robust):** Hardened multiple service workers (root `sw.js`, `docs/sw.js`, and app-specific workers) so fetch handlers always return a `Response`, added network-first navigation fallbacks, cache-first asset strategies, and explicit error fallbacks to avoid TypeErrors and broken fetch responses.
- **Registration safety:** Added a HEAD-check before registering workers to avoid attempting to register 404 worker scripts.
- **Docs paths & local preview:** Converted production absolute `/labs/...` asset paths in local-preview pages to local-relative imports for reliable local `python -m http.server` previews; `scripts/update-static-paths.js` continues to rewrite paths for GitHub Pages during deploy/commit.
- **Storybook & icons:** Resolved Storybook duplicate story id, removed an incorrect static mapping, and re-ran icon generation + sync so icons display correctly in Storybook and docs.

### Chore
- **Deployment:** Full build-and-deploy run (`npm run d`) completed; Storybook static build exported to `design-system/storybook-static` and public assets copied into `docs/design-system/`. Live URLs: `https://dreisdesign.github.io/labs/` and `https://dreisdesign.github.io/labs/design-system/`.

  - Settings card includes built-in dark mode and flavor buttons with proper theming
- **Component Enhancements:**
  - Added `metric` variant to `labs-card` with H1 typography tokens
  - Added `text-only` variant to `labs-list-item` for timestamp-only displays
  - Enhanced `labs-settings-card` with theme toggle and flavor selection

  - Enhanced file filtering with regex patterns to identify built assets vs. intended component files
  - Added directory exclusions for `assets/`, `sb-addons/`, `sb-manager/` to prevent processing Storybook build artifacts
- **Menu System Refinements:**
  - Fixed local preview mode to use `--public` paths instead of auto-detection for consistent local development
  - Improved workflow reliability for `npm run l` (local preview) command
  - Ensures correct path rewriting for all deployment scenarios (local, public, GitHub Pages)

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- **New `labs-dropdown` component** - Modular overflow menu component with icon trigger and card-style menu
- **`fullwidth` attribute for `labs-button`** - Universal 100% width support for buttons in containers
- **`more_vert` icon** - Added Material Design more vertical icon for dropdown triggers

### Changed
- **Surface variant tokens** - Added proper theme-specific surface variant tokens for all flavors (Vanilla, Blueberry, Strawberry) to fix hardcoded vanilla colors in common.css
- **Button alignment** - Improved right-alignment and 100% width behavior for buttons in dropdown menus
- **Icon button improvements** - Enhanced icon-only button styling and layout consistency

### Fixed
- **Theme-specific surface colors** - Fixed `--color-surface-variant` and related container tokens to use proper flavor-specific colors instead of hardcoded vanilla

- **Icon generation** - Updated icon list generation to include new `more_vert` icon

---

## [Previous] - 2025-09-15

### Changed
- `labs-input-card` default updated to a two-line textarea (`rows=2`) with keyboard save on Ctrl/Cmd+Enter. (commit `76e1b47`)
- Settings/input overlays use `transparent` mode so the overlay only renders the backdrop and the card component supplies the visible surface (fixes double-wrapping). Mirrored to docs and stories. (commit `76e1b47`)
- `labs-list-item` archive action switched from icon-only to a small labelled secondary `Archive` button for accessibility and discoverability. (commit `76e1b47`)
- Documentation mirrors updated in `docs/design-system/*` and `docs/today-list/TODO.md` updated (commit `3e03fd4`).
