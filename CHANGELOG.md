# [Unreleased] - 2025-09-20

### Added
- **PWA (minimal):** Registered a minimal service worker with a small precache list, navigation-fallback, and cache-first strategy for same-origin assets to provide basic offline navigation and improve resilience. (commit `f333b85`)

### Fixed
- **Settings (safety):** `labs-settings-card` now only probes `http://localhost:8000/` when the current page is a local dev page to avoid opening localhost from production/demo pages. (commit `842057c`)

### Chore
- **Deploy automation:** Multiple automated deploy commits ensured `docs/design-system/` assets are synced and asset paths were rewritten for GitHub Pages. (commits `02743f4`, `9e724a2`, `13bad60`)

# ÔøΩ v2.4.4 - Fixed Asset Path Script & Build Process (September 10, 2025)

### üêõ **Build System Fixes**

  - Fixed `update-static-paths.js` to exclude hashed build files (e.g., `iframe-XXXXXXXX.js`) that shouldn't be modified
  - Enhanced file filtering with regex patterns to identify built assets vs. intended component files
  - Added directory exclusions for `assets/`, `sb-addons/`, `sb-manager/` to prevent processing Storybook build artifacts
- **Menu System Refinements:**
  - Fixed local preview mode to use `--public` paths instead of auto-detection for consistent local development
  - Improved workflow reliability for `npm run l` (local preview) command
  - Ensures correct path rewriting for all deployment scenarios (local, public, GitHub Pages)

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- **New `labs-dropdown` component** - Modular overflow menu component with icon trigger and card-style menu
- **`fullwidth` attribute for `labs-button`** - Universal 100% width support for buttons in containers
- **`more_vert` icon** - Added Material Design more vertical icon for dropdown triggers

### Changed
- **Surface variant tokens** - Added proper theme-specific surface variant tokens for all flavors (Vanilla, Blueberry, Strawberry) to fix hardcoded vanilla colors in common.css
- **Button alignment** - Improved right-alignment and 100% width behavior for buttons in dropdown menus
- **Icon button improvements** - Enhanced icon-only button styling and layout consistency

### Fixed
- **Theme-specific surface colors** - Fixed `--color-surface-variant` and related container tokens to use proper flavor-specific colors instead of hardcoded vanilla
- **Dropdown button width** - Resolved issue where native buttons inside `labs-button` weren't filling container width
- **Icon generation** - Updated icon list generation to include new `more_vert` icon

---

## [Previous] - 2025-09-15

### Changed
- `labs-input-card` default updated to a two-line textarea (`rows=2`) with keyboard save on Ctrl/Cmd+Enter. (commit `76e1b47`)
- Settings/input overlays use `transparent` mode so the overlay only renders the backdrop and the card component supplies the visible surface (fixes double-wrapping). Mirrored to docs and stories. (commit `76e1b47`)
- `labs-list-item` archive action switched from icon-only to a small labelled secondary `Archive` button for accessibility and discoverability. (commit `76e1b47`)
- Documentation mirrors updated in `docs/design-system/*` and `docs/today-list/TODO.md` updated (commit `3e03fd4`).
