## 🐛 **CURRENT TESTING & FIXES**

### **✅ FIXES APPLIED:**

| Component | Issue | Root Cause | Status |
|-----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Checkbox Demo | Not responding to clicks | ✅ **FIXED** - Event listener lost on render | ✅ **WORKING** |
| Task Interaction | Checkbox not working | ✅ **FIXED** - Same issue | ✅ **WORKING** |
| Task Interaction | Edit button not working | ✅ **FIXED** - Wrong event name in story | ✅ **WORKING** |
| Checkbox iconcolor | Color not persisting when checked | ✅ **FIXED** - Override logic improved | ✅ **WORKING** |
