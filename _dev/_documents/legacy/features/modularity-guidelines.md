## Common Problems & Solutions

### 1. Button Width Issues in Containers (Shadow DOM Components)

**Problem**: When using custom elements with shadow DOM (like `labs-button`), CSS from parent containers cannot penetrate the shadow boundary to style nested elements like the native `<button>` inside.

**Symptoms**:
- Button appears to be 100% width but native button inside stays narrow
- `width: 100%` on host element doesn't affect nested button
- `display: inline-flex` prevents width stretching in flex containers

**Failed Solutions** (multiple attempts):
- Adding CSS targeting `.menu labs-button button` with `!important`
- Setting parent container width dynamically
- Removing inline styles
- Setting host element to `display: block`

**Working Solution**: 
- **Add component-level attributes** that modify internal styling
- Added `fullwidth` attribute to `labs-button` component itself
- Component internally handles both host and native button styling when attribute present

```html
<!-- Instead of complex CSS overrides -->
<labs-button fullwidth variant="secondary">Archive</labs-button>
<labs-button fullwidth variant="destructive">Delete</labs-button>
```

**User Confirmation**: "Finally - and is this modular?" â†’ "great!"

### 2. Theme Management & Token Application

**Problem**: Typography tokens not being applied consistently, especially for large numeric displays.

**Working Solution**: 
- Created dedicated `metric` variant for `labs-card` component
- Used H1 typography tokens specifically for large numbers
- Ensured proper token cascade through CSS custom properties

**User Confirmation**: "Finally! - make sure that the story shows the new tokens"

### 3. Component Variant Design Pattern

**Problem**: Need for specialized component behavior without creating entirely new components.

**Working Solution**:
- Use semantic attribute-based variants (`metric`, `text-only`, `fullwidth`)
- Handle variant logic inside component CSS/JS
- Document variants in Storybook with proper examples

**Examples from successful implementations**:
- `labs-card` metric variant for large numbers
- `labs-list-item` text-only variant for timestamps
- `labs-button` fullwidth attribute for container layouts

## Key Development Principles

### 1. Component-First Solutions
When CSS targeting fails with shadow DOM:
- **Don't fight the shadow boundary** with complex selectors
- **Add component attributes** that modify internal behavior
- **Make components self-contained** and context-aware

### 2. Modular Design Validation
Always ask: "Is this modular?" 
- Solution should work across different contexts
- Avoid component-specific CSS in parent containers
- Prefer semantic attributes over layout-specific CSS

### 3. User Feedback Integration
Key phrases that indicate successful solutions:
- "Finally!" - indicates previous attempts failed
- "great!" - confirms solution works
- "Perfect!" - user validation of success

## Preventive Measures

### 1. Shadow DOM Component Design
When creating web components:
- Always consider container layout scenarios
- Provide attributes for common layout needs (`fullwidth`, etc.)
- Test in various parent contexts (dropdowns, cards, lists)

### 2. CSS Architecture
- Avoid over-relying on external CSS to style component internals
- Use CSS custom properties for flexible theming
- Implement variant attributes rather than modifier classes

### 3. Documentation Requirements
- Document all component attributes in Storybook
- Show examples of variants in different contexts
- Maintain component changelogs with variant additions

## Tools & Debugging

### Effective Debugging Sequence
1. **Check shadow DOM boundaries** - use browser dev tools
2. **Identify if CSS can reach target** - check computed styles
3. **Consider component-level solution** - add attributes/variants
4. **Test modularity** - verify solution works in multiple contexts

### Browser Development Tools
- Use Elements panel to inspect shadow DOM structure
- Check Computed styles to see what CSS actually applies
- Verify that `width: 100%` reaches the intended target element

## Integration with Existing Instructions

### Updates Needed for task-management.instructions.md

Add to **Component Development** section:
```markdown
## Shadow DOM Component Guidelines
- When CSS targeting fails, prefer component attributes over complex selectors
- Always test components in container scenarios (dropdowns, cards, flexbox)
- Add semantic attributes for common layout needs (fullwidth, variants)
- Validate modularity: "Does this work across different contexts?"
```

### New Section for Web Component Best Practices
```markdown
## Web Component Layout Attributes
- `fullwidth` - for 100% width in any container
- Variant attributes for specialized styling
- Always handle both host element and internal element styling
- Test in various parent containers before finalizing
```
