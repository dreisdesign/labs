Storybook UI
- Can we change the theme of storybook itself to light?
- Can we default controls orientation to be on the right?

0. Sidebar
Is there a more common / modern, better way to organize the sidebar?


1. Tokens / Colors http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/tokens-colors--colors&globals=theme:light
1A. Some text colors in the swatches are not visible when in light/dark mode. Maybe we do a different way to represent it since we are currently using text on swatch - but that doesn't make sense because there is a section with Text and so the text itself needs to be legible. Is there a more common / modern, better way to showcase color tokens?

2. Tokens / Typography http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/tokens-typography--typography
- Is there a more common / modern, better way to showcase Typography tokens?

3. Tokens / Spacing http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/tokens-spacing--spacing
- Is there a more common / modern , better way to showcase Spacing tokens?

4. Components / Button / Button Shop http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/components-labs-button--button-shop
Destructive Actions:
-  Reset All Data should be red and then red with white text on hover

4B. UI/Navigation Buttons:
-  Settings should actually be just the icon - see my Tracker app for implementation and animation reference. 
- All Apps icon is invisible

4C. Icon-Only Buttons: 
- the one to the right of settings is invisible. Hover states are missing (should change color)

5. Icons / Default http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/icons-default--default
- Can we increase the default size for the story?
- Size control doesn't seeem to be working
- Is there a more common / modern, better way to showcase Icons?

6. Icons / Preview / Grid http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/icons-preview--grid
Is there a more common / modern, better way to showcase All Icons?

7. Components / Button / Primary http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/components-button--default
Is there a more common / modern, better way to showcase Buttons?
- Should there be stories for more than just Primary?

8. 7. Components / Button / Container Variants http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/components-button--container-variants
- This is using the settings overlay but it's confusing because it looks the same as this: http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/patterns-settings-overlay--default
Is there a more common / modern, better way to showcase a settings overlay?


9. Demo Page / App Interface
http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/patterns-demo-page--app-interface
- Would it make more sense to move this to the top of the sidebar? 
- Reset All Data should be red
- Is there a more common / modern, better way to showcase the App Inteface Demo?
