# Labs Design System

> **Production-Ready Component Library with Complete Token Architecture**

---

## Overview

This is the canonical design system for Labs apps, featuring a comprehensive two-layer token system, semantic color architecture, and modular Web Components. All UI components, design tokens, and documentation are maintained here with full theme support and accessibility compliance.


**üéØ Current Status: Production-Ready & Robust**

**2025-09-05 Update:**
- All icons in Labs apps and demos must use the `<labs-icon>` component and the design system icon set (see `src/components/labs-icon.js`).
- Inlined SVGs are not allowed in app or demo markup; all icons are loaded dynamically from the icon set for consistency and maintainability.
- Theme and flavor toggles in all apps are now fully consistent with Storybook and the design system.
- ‚úÖ Complete semantic token system with "on-" text color pairings
- ‚úÖ Three-flavor theming (Vanilla, Blueberry, Strawberry) with light/dark modes
- ‚úÖ WCAG AA accessibility compliance across all combinations
- ‚úÖ Strategic Storybook documentation with Base column and reorganized Colors story
- ‚úÖ Robust Colors story: all tokens and flavors now display correct base mapping and theme-driven polaroid labels

## üÜï Recent UX & Component Improvements

### Archive/Restore Logic for List Items
- List items (`<labs-list-item>`) now visually distinguish between normal, archived, and restored (inactive) states.
- The archive button icon changes to a history icon when archived, and becomes inactive (faded) when restored.
- See the new Storybook story: `List Item/Archived` for a live demo of all states.

### Input Card & Destructive Button UX
- Input cards now have `autocomplete="off"` for better browser UX.
- Destructive button icons (e.g., delete/reset) now always use the correct error color in all themes.
