# Labs Design System

> **Production-Ready Component Library with Complete Token Architecture**

---

## Overview

This is the canonical design system for Labs apps, featuring a comprehensive two-layer token system, semantic color architecture, and modular Web Components. All UI components, design tokens, and documentation are maintained here with full theme support and accessibility compliance.


**🎯 Current Status: Production-Ready & Robust**

**2025-09-05 Update:**
- All icons in Labs apps and demos must use the `<labs-icon>` component and the design system icon set (see `src/components/labs-icon.js`).
- Inlined SVGs are not allowed in app or demo markup; all icons are loaded dynamically from the icon set for consistency and maintainability.
- Theme and flavor toggles in all apps are now fully consistent with Storybook and the design system.
- ✅ Complete semantic token system with "on-" text color pairings
- ✅ Three-flavor theming (Vanilla, Blueberry, Strawberry) with light/dark modes
- ✅ WCAG AA accessibility compliance across all combinations
- ✅ Strategic Storybook documentation with Base column and reorganized Colors story
- ✅ Robust Colors story: all tokens and flavors now display correct base mapping and theme-driven polaroid labels
