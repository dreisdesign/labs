# [v2.1.6] - 2025-09-01 - Storybook docs dark-preview & token fixes

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-15

### Changed
	- Input card: default input changed to a two-line textarea (`rows=2`) with keyboard save on Ctrl/Cmd+Enter. See commit `76e1b47`.
	- Overlay: use `transparent` overlay mode for settings/input overlays so overlays provide backdrop only and the card component supplies the visible surface (fixes double-wrapping). Mirrored to Storybook stories and docs. See commit `76e1b47`.
	- Labs List Item: replaced icon-only archive action with a small labelled secondary `Archive` button for improved discoverability and accessibility. See commit `76e1b47`.
	- Documentation: mirrored component changes into `docs/design-system/*` and updated Today List TODO. See commit `3e03fd4`.

# [v2.1.6] - 2025-09-01 - Storybook docs dark-preview & token fixes

### ÔøΩÔ∏è Fixes & Improvements
- Storybook docs previews now respect the dark theme global (`?globals=theme:dark`) by using design tokens for preview surfaces and cards (`--color-surface`, `--color-on-surface`, `--color-background`, `--color-on-background`).
- Added token-aware Storybook CSS overrides and linked them via `.storybook/preview-head.html` to ensure autodocs previews inherit theme tokens in both dev and static builds.
- Hardened the docs decorator to avoid coercing lit TemplateResult and DOM Node story outputs (fixes `[object Object]` rendering and double-wrapping of some stories).
- Updated `icons-grid` story to use token-based backgrounds and set the default icon color to `var(--color-on-surface)` so icons remain visible in dark mode.

# [v2.1.4] - 2025-08-28 - Robust Colors Story & Theme Mapping
### üöÄ Major Improvements
	- All theme flavors (Vanilla, Blueberry, Strawberry) now display correct base mapping for every token.
	- Diagnostic and fallback logic ensures every semantic and palette token is mapped to a friendly label, even if the chain is missing.
	- Polaroid label color now always inherits from the theme (no forced inline color), ensuring correct appearance in all themes.
	- Strategic Storybook documentation and grid layout improvements.
- **Token Architecture:**
	- Two-layer system (palette + semantic) is now fully production-ready and robust for all flavors and themes.
	- All color/theming TODOs are now complete; only future enhancements remain.

## [v2.1.5] - 2025-08-31 - Minor parity fixes

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes & polish
- **Colors story:** Global `<details>` uses `--color-surface` / `--color-on-surface` so the Global palette renders using the neutral base (Base 100) consistent with themed sections.
- **Button component:** Icon-only variant updated to prefer `--color-on-surface` (falling back to `--settings-icon-color` then `--color-primary`) to match secondary-with-icon opacity/contrast in dark mode.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Menu-Driven Workflow & AI Chat Policy** - Adopted explicit, menu-driven workflow and AI Chat task continuation policy for all design system development. See `.github/instructions/development-workflow.instructions.md` for details.
