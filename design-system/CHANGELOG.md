# [v2.1.6] - 2025-09-01 - Storybook docs dark-preview & token fixes

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-15

### Changed
	- Input card: default input changed to a two-line textarea (`rows=2`) with keyboard save on Ctrl/Cmd+Enter. See commit `76e1b47`.
	- Overlay: use `transparent` overlay mode for settings/input overlays so overlays provide backdrop only and the card component supplies the visible surface (fixes double-wrapping). Mirrored to Storybook stories and docs. See commit `76e1b47`.
	- Labs List Item: replaced icon-only archive action with a small labelled secondary `Archive` button for improved discoverability and accessibility. See commit `76e1b47`.
	- Documentation: mirrored component changes into `docs/design-system/*` and updated Today List TODO. See commit `3e03fd4`.

	### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Completed ‚Äî Dropdown Separation (2025-09-19)

	- Extracted and stabilized `labs-dropdown` as a standalone component. Changes include:
		- Icon-only default trigger and `open` variant for explicit open state.
		- Added ARIA attributes: `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` and `role="menu"` / `role="menuitem"` semantics for menu and items.
		- Keyboard interaction and focus management for Enter/Space/Arrow/Escape/Home/End.
		- Storybook stories added: `IconOnly`, `Open`, `InList` and updated `Default` to show icon-only dropdown.
		- Storybook rebuilt and docs assets synced to `docs/design-system/` for preview.

# [v2.1.6] - 2025-09-01 - Storybook docs dark-preview & token fixes

### ÔøΩÔ∏è Fixes & Improvements
- Storybook docs previews now respect the dark theme global (`?globals=theme:dark`) by using design tokens for preview surfaces and cards (`--color-surface`, `--color-on-surface`, `--color-background`, `--color-on-background`).
- Added token-aware Storybook CSS overrides and linked them via `.storybook/preview-head.html` to ensure autodocs previews inherit theme tokens in both dev and static builds.
- Hardened the docs decorator to avoid coercing lit TemplateResult and DOM Node story outputs (fixes `[object Object]` rendering and double-wrapping of some stories).
- Updated `icons-grid` story to use token-based backgrounds and set the default icon color to `var(--color-on-surface)` so icons remain visible in dark mode.

# [v2.1.4] - 2025-08-28 - Robust Colors Story & Theme Mapping
### üöÄ Major Improvements
	- All theme flavors (Vanilla, Blueberry, Strawberry) now display correct base mapping for every token.
	- Diagnostic and fallback logic ensures every semantic and palette token is mapped to a friendly label, even if the chain is missing.
	- Polaroid label color now always inherits from the theme (no forced inline color), ensuring correct appearance in all themes.
	- Strategic Storybook documentation and grid layout improvements.
- **Token Architecture:**
	- Two-layer system (palette + semantic) is now fully production-ready and robust for all flavors and themes.
	- All color/theming TODOs are now complete; only future enhancements remain.

## [v2.1.5] - 2025-08-31 - Minor parity fixes

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes & polish
- **Colors story:** Global `<details>` uses `--color-surface` / `--color-on-surface` so the Global palette renders using the neutral base (Base 100) consistent with themed sections.
- **Button component:** Icon-only variant updated to prefer `--color-on-surface` (falling back to `--settings-icon-color` then `--color-primary`) to match secondary-with-icon opacity/contrast in dark mode.



> This changelog tracks only the Labs Design System package. For global project milestones, see the [main Labs changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Menu-Driven Workflow & AI Chat Policy** - Adopted explicit, menu-driven workflow and AI Chat task continuation policy for all design system development. See `.github/instructions/development-workflow.instructions.md` for details.

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Card/Welcome Centering, Modularity, and Storybook Controls Cleanup

- **labs-card**: Actions area is now always centered using pure flexbox (no slot wrappers, no margin tricks). This guarantees robust, modular centering for all slotted content in the actions slot, regardless of structure.
- **Storybook**: Removed the obsolete `align` control from the canonical Card/Welcome story. The only supported alignment is now `center` for maximum modularity and clarity. For advanced alignment, consumers can wrap actions in a primitive container (see story comment for example).
- **labs-button**: Icon-only variant color is now always `--color-on-surface` for consistent appearance in all contexts. Disabled state uses `opacity: 0.5` for improved accessibility.
- **labs-checkbox**: No longer forcibly disables the internal button; now matches modular button behavior and accessibility.
- **labs-settings-card**: Added safety check to prevent reset-all action if the button is disabled.
- **Today-List App**: Welcome card now always sets `align="center"` for empty state, ensuring the add button is perfectly centered.

**Modularity**: All changes follow the modularity guidelines‚Äîno external CSS, all layout logic is internal, and advanced alignment is opt-in via a documented primitive container pattern.

**Storybook**: All stories and controls are updated for clarity and parity with the new modular approach.

---

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Tracker App Parity: Welcome Card Pattern

- **Tracker app** now uses the modular labs-card welcome card for its empty state, matching Today-List. This is now the canonical pattern for all Labs apps: always use `<labs-card variant="welcome" align="center">` for empty states, with header, description, and a primary action button.
