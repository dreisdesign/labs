# Buttons Patterns

This page documents button usage patterns for the Labs Design System. The canonical component is `<labs-button>` (see Components → Button). Patterns are usage examples and recipes built from the base component.

- Icon Only: Use the `Icon Only` pattern when a compact, icon-only control is required. See Patterns → Buttons → Icon Only.
- Standard actions: Primary, Secondary, Destructive — use the `variant` attribute on `<labs-button>`.

## Usage notes

- Patterns are examples, not new components. Prefer the main `<labs-button>` component for API and props.
- For accessibility, always include an `aria-label` on icon-only buttons.

For live examples, open the **Icon Only** pattern story in Storybook under Patterns → Buttons.
