## Outstanding Tasks

- [ ] **Component Gaps**
  - [ ] Tooltips on hover — Add to all interactive elements
  - [ ] "Disabled" terminology — Update to "inactive/active" (less negative)
  - [ ] `labs-input` range slider — For brush size controls
  - [ ] `labs-sortable-list` — Enhanced drag-drop support (note: `labs-list-item` supports drag-drop, but no dedicated sortable wrapper)

- [ ] **Storybook & Documentation**
  - [ ] Wrapped component stories — Ensure all components have real-world usage examples
  - [ ] About page (Storybook) — Recover and update the "About" section
