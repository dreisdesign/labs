# Project TODO




**AI: THIS IS NOT A CHANGELOG.**

**This is the canonical project-wide TODO index file.** Use this ONLY as an index of links to area- and feature-specific TODO files. This is NOT a changelog - do not track completed work here. Keep all detailed todos in the linked files to maintain clarity and focus.

**Guidelines:**
- Link to area-specific TODO files (e.g., `design-system/TODO.md`, `docs/timer/TODO.md`)
- Reference feature-specific TODOs (e.g., `COLORS-TODO.md`) from appropriate area files
- Never rename TODO files for branches; keep single canonical files for continuity
- Remove completed items; add new actionable tasks as they emerge
- This file should remain concise and focused on active work
