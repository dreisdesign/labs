## 🛠️ Development Workflow & AI Chat Policy

### Menu-Driven Workflow (Recommended)
All development and testing should use the menu-driven workflow for consistency and automation:

```bash
echo "1" | npm run menu
```

This ensures the correct environment, auto-port-kill, and the interactive "continue" button in the VS Code terminal. Avoid using `npm run menu` alone for AI-driven workflows.

### Explicit AI Chat Task Continuation Policy
For all AI-driven development, the assistant will:
- Always provide explicit, numbered options for next steps
- Only prompt for completion when all tasks are truly complete
- Never end a turn without either fully completing all tasks or providing the next actionable step
- See `.github/instructions/development-workflow.instructions.md` for the full policy and details

**Reference:** See [Development Workflow Instructions](.github/instructions/development-workflow.instructions.md) for the latest workflow and AI Chat guidelines.
