## 🛡️ Icon Management Workflow (2025-10-15)

All icon SVGs in `design-system/icons/` **must** end with `--labs-icons.svg`. This is enforced by both the sync and cleanup scripts.

**Automated Cleanup:**
- Run `node scripts/cleanup-icon-dupes.js && npm run rp` to automatically rename unsuffixed icons or remove unsuffixed duplicates.
- The cleanup script only operates on the source folder (`design-system/icons/`), never on build or destination folders.

**Sync Script Safety:**
- The sync script (`sync-icons.js`) only checks for filename issues (missing suffix or duplicates) and halts with a clear message if any are found.
- No files are renamed or deleted by the sync script; all changes are made explicitly via the cleanup utility.

**Manual Intervention Required:**
- If the sync script halts, it prints the exact command to run for cleanup.
- This ensures no accidental data loss and keeps the workflow safe and user-driven.

**Duplicate Handling:**
- The cleanup script renames unsuffixed icons if no suffixed version exists, or deletes the unsuffixed file if a suffixed version is present.
- Only suffixed icons are allowed in the source directory.

**Workflow Integration:**
- The cleanup utility is available in the Utilities submenu for easy access.
- The `rp` script halts before starting servers if icon issues are detected, preventing wasted build time.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If icons are missing or not appearing, always check for correct suffixes and run the cleanup utility.
- If syntax errors appear in `labs-icon.js` after running the icon generation script, check for duplicate or malformed code blocks (especially duplicate `ICON_BASE` declarations or unquoted object keys).

### Common Pitfalls & FAQ

- **Q: Why does the sync script halt and print a cleanup command?**
    - **A:** To prevent accidental data loss and ensure all icons are correctly suffixed before syncing. All destructive actions are isolated to the cleanup utility, never in the sync script.

- **Q: Why aren't my icons showing up?**
    - **A:** Check that all icon filenames end with `--labs-icons.svg` and run the cleanup utility if needed.

- **Q: Why do I see syntax errors in labs-icon.js after running icon generation?**
    - **A:** This can happen if the icon generation script merges or appends icon definitions incorrectly. Check for duplicate or malformed code blocks, especially duplicate `ICON_BASE` declarations or unquoted object keys.

- **Q: How do I safely clean up icons?**
    - **A:** Always use `node scripts/cleanup-icon-dupes.js` to rename or remove unsuffixed icons. Never delete icons manually unless you are certain they are not needed.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

**Option 1: Menu-driven workflow (recommended)**
```bash
npm run menu
# Choose option 1 for local development
```

**Option 2: Quick preview**
```bash
npm run rp
```

This command:
- ✅ Updates static paths for local preview
- ✅ Kills any existing servers on ports 6006/8000
- ✅ Starts Python http.server for Labs Homepage (port 8000)
- ✅ Starts Storybook dev server (port 6006)
- ✅ Shows live build progress with timing
- ✅ Auto-opens both URLs in your browser
- ✅ Leaves servers running in background

**Development URLs:**
- Storybook: http://localhost:6006
- Labs Homepage: http://localhost:8000
- Apps: http://localhost:8000/{app}/ (e.g., /tracker/, /today-list/)


### Icon Management Workflow

**All icon SVGs in `design-system/icons/` must end with `--labs-icons.svg`.**

If you see a warning about unsuffixed icons when running `npm run rp`, fix it by running:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-icon-dupes.js && npm run rp
```

This will automatically rename unsuffixed icons or remove duplicates, then restart the workflow. Only the source folder is affected.

If an icon is missing in the UI, check that its SVG filename ends with `--labs-icons.svg`.

---

### Icon Path Logic (Static, Dev, GitHub Pages)

Icons are served under:
- `/design-system/icons/` for local dev
- `/icons/` for Storybook dev server
- `./icons/` for static Storybook output
- `/labs/design-system/icons/` for GitHub Pages

If icons are missing in Storybook static output, ensure `labs-icon.js` uses a relative path (`./icons/`) for static builds. The icon loader now auto-detects static, dev, and GitHub Pages environments.

---

### Deployment

```bash
npm run d
```

This builds Storybook, syncs to `docs/`, updates paths for GitHub Pages, and deploys.

## 🏁 Quick Start

---

## 🔗 Design System Link Workflow

**For the Labs homepage (`docs/index.html`):**

- Always commit with `href="../design-system/"` for the design system link. This ensures local preview works out of the box.
- The deploy/build script (run with `--github` or as part of `npm run d`) will automatically rewrite this link to `href="/labs/design-system/"` for GitHub Pages.
- **Never commit the deploy output** with `/labs/design-system/` — only the local-friendly `../design-system/`.

This ensures the link is always correct in both local and deployed environments, with no manual changes needed.


### October 10, 2025
- **Icon Workflow Automation:** Icon cleanup and generation scripts now robustly enforce suffixes, quote all icon names, and only update the icons object in `labs-icon.js` between comment markers. No more file corruption or manual fixes needed.
- **Safe Cleanup:** `cleanup-icon-dupes.js` matches manual workflow—deletes unsuffixed duplicates, renames unsuffixed icons, and never touches suffixed icons.
- **Valid JS Generation:** All icon property names are quoted, so icons with hyphens or special characters are always valid.

### October 4, 2025
- Fixed Storybook assets 404s (removed from .gitignore)
- Fixed tracker date-format.js dynamic import
- Enhanced path management for local/production environments
- Updated comprehensive development documentation

### September 30, 2025
- Dropdown portal system for eliminating menu clipping
- List item component refinements
- Storybook alphabetical sorting

### September 21, 2025
- Service worker stability improvements
- Robust fetch handlers with proper fallbacks
- Local preview path fixes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for complete version history.
