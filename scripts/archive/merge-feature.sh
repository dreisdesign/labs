# merge-feature.sh - Merge feature branch into main for any project
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/merge-feature.sh [options]
#
# OPTIONS:
#   -p, --project <name>   Specify project name (required if script called from labs directory)
#   -b, --branch <name>    Specify branch name to merge (defaults to current branch)
#   -s, --squash           Merge with squash (combine all commits into one)
#   --no-delete            Don't delete branch after merging
#   -h, --help             Display this help message
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script merges a feature branch into the main branch for any project in the labs directory.
#   It handles stashing uncommitted changes, pulling latest changes from main, 
#   performing the merge, and pushing the changes to the remote repository.
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   ./scripts/merge-feature.sh                  - Merge current branch into main (when run from project dir)
#   ./scripts/merge-feature.sh -p tracker       - Merge current branch into tracker's main
#   ./scripts/merge-feature.sh -b feature-123   - Merge branch feature-123 into main
#   ./scripts/merge-feature.sh -s               - Squash merge current branch into main
#   ./scripts/merge-feature.sh --no-delete      - Don't delete branch after merging
