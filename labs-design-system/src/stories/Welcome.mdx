# Labs Design System

Welcome to the **Labs Design System** - a comprehensive component library and design token system extracted from the proven patterns used across the Labs ecosystem of applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This design system ensures consistency, accessibility, and maintainability across all Labs applications including:

- **Tracker** - Time tracking and productivity metrics
- **Note** - Quick note-taking and thoughts capture  
- **Timer** - Pomodoro and focus session management
- **Today List** - Daily task management (coming soon)

## ðŸ§± Foundation

Our design system is built on:

- **Design Tokens** - Systematic color, typography, spacing, and layout variables
- **Component Library** - Reusable UI components with multiple variants and states
- **Living Documentation** - This Storybook instance with interactive examples
- **Demo Environment** - Real-world testing playground at `/demo/`

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles

### Consistency
All components follow the same design patterns, interaction behaviors, and visual hierarchy extracted from the Tracker app's proven interface.

### Accessibility  
Components support keyboard navigation, screen readers, and include proper ARIA attributes. We use inclusive language like "inactive" instead of "disabled" in user-facing text.

### Theme Support
Full light and dark mode support with carefully crafted color contrasts and focus states.

### Real-World Tested
Every component and pattern has been validated through actual use in production Labs applications.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### For Developers
1. **Explore Components** - Browse the component stories in the sidebar
2. **Check Design Tokens** - Review color, typography, and spacing systems
3. **Test in Demo** - Use the [Demo Environment](file:///Users/danielreis/labs/demo/index.html) for integration testing
4. **Implementation** - Import CSS files and use documented class patterns

### For Designers
1. **Review Tokens** - All design decisions are systematized as CSS custom properties
2. **Component Variants** - Each component shows all available states and configurations
3. **Theme Switching** - Test both light and dark modes in any story

## ðŸ”„ Living System

This is a **living design system** that maintains 1:1 parity between:
- Storybook documentation (this site)
- Demo environment testing
- Production application usage

Any changes here automatically reflect in all Labs applications and vice versa.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

- [ ] Add Input field components
- [ ] Create Checkbox and form controls  
- [ ] Build Modal/Overlay system
- [ ] Implement Today List using this system
- [ ] Expand animation and interaction tokens
