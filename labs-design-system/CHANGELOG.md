## Migration Notes

This is the first formal release of the Labs Design System. Previously, design patterns were embedded directly within individual applications. This release centralizes and systematizes those patterns for:

- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all Labs applications
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for design decisions
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new components and tokens
- **Quality**: Comprehensive testing and documentation for all patterns

## Future Roadmap

### v1.1.0 - Form Components
- Input field components (text, textarea, email, password)
- Checkbox and radio button systems
- Form validation patterns
- Field grouping and layout utilities

### v1.2.0 - Layout & Navigation
- Header and footer components
- Navigation menu systems
- Modal and overlay components
- Grid and flex layout utilities

### v1.3.0 - Today List Integration
- Task-specific components
- List management patterns
- Progress indicators
- Notification systems

### v2.0.0 - Advanced Features
- Animation system expansion
